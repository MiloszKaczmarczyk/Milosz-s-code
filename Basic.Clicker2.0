<p>Git removes the need of versioning your work by using separate files. You can have your source code 
divided into separate branches instead. Your next task is to create a new branch under your repository and continue
development within the new branch from now on leaving the master branch intact.</p>

	Clicker: <button type =  "submit" name = "Clicks"  > Make a coin </button>

For your file to be processed as one containing PHP code you need to change its extension to .php
